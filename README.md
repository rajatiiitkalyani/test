Just clone the repo and go to the test directory .
Do npm start
Yet i could just do backend for login , signup and made one protected route to fetch the data of logged in user.
Signup Api:http://localhost:5000/api/signup   type:Post
Params : name ,phone and password 
In headers : [{"key":"Content-Type","name":"Content-Type","value":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded","description":"","type":"text"}]
Api for login:http://localhost:5000/api/login
params: phone and password
In headers : [{"key":"Content-Type","name":"Content-Type","value":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded","description":"","type":"text"}]
And the protected route is http://localhost:5000/api/current
in headers : Authorization : "token that you get after login"
in case any problem you can call me 9450974320
I have used node.js and mongodb
Thank you
